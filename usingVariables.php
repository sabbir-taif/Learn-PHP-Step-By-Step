Using Variables

Once we’ve declared a variable and assigned a value to it, we can use it as many times as we want. We refer to a variable by using the dollar sign followed by the variable’s name.
*/

$favorite_food = "Red curry with eggplant, green beans, and peanuts";
echo $favorite_food; // Prints: Red curry with eggplant, green beans, and peanuts

/*
Except during assignment, whenever the computer sees a variable in your code, it replaces the variable with the value assigned to that variable.
*/

$dog_name = "Tadpole";
echo $dog_name; // Prints: Tadpole

/*
Since the computer treats a variable just as if it were the value it holds, this means we can do operations on variables just as we would with any value of that type.
*/

$dog_name = "Tadpole";
echo "My dog is named " . $dog_name; // Prints: My dog is named Tadpole

/*
In the code above, we concatenated the string "My dog is named " to the value held by the $dog_name variable ("Tadpole"). Let’s look at another example that uses multiple variables:
*/

$dog_name = "Tadpole";
$favorite_food = "salmon";
$color = "brown";
 
echo "I have a " . $color . " dog named " . $dog_name . " and her favorite food is " . $favorite_food . "."; // Prints: I have a brown dog named Tadpole and her favorite food is salmon.

/*
Let’s use some variables!

Instructions

1.
You’re going to create a couple variables. The variable, $name, should be assigned your name as a string. The second,$language, should be assigned a string value representing a language you’re learning.
*/

$name = "Md. Sabbir Rahman";
$language = "I am learning PHP";

/*
2.
Use echo to print any string you’d like with the $name variable concatenated to it.
*/

echo "My name is".$name;

/*
3.
Use echo to print a string starting with a newline (\n) with $language variable concatenated to it.
*/

echo "\nI love ".$language." very much";
